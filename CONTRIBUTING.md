Contributing
----------------------------------

1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
----------------------------------

Use the tracker issues to start the discussion. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
the feature exists already.

Style Guides
-------------------
1. Look at the existing style and adhere accordingly
2. Linters will be added later to reinforce styling in the repository.

Make the Pull Request
---------------------

Once you have made all your changes and updated the documentation,
make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the
`repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these
rules.
